This is a collection of some of the scripts I've made:

## FireWallConfig.sh
Setup the ufw firewall with rules, prompts for input about your current config such as apache, ssh and nginx, then configurates
the ufw firewall to deny accordingly.
Default setting is highest security denying all incoming ports, and allowing only outgoing on port 53, 80 and 443.
53 is needed for DNS.


## FailToBan.sh
Setup FailToBan so that people trying to hack or crawl the site without being a verified crawler (such as googlebot) gets banned
repeated offenders get permanently banned.


## Antivirus.sh
Setup clamscan, chkrootkit and rkhunter with log files and cronjobs to automatically run once a week.
